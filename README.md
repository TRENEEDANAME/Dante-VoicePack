## Description

This is the github repository of the **mod project** folder for my [Dante Voicepack mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844999048). 
This will be the most up to date project folder from the mod, even before it's on steam

## How to build the mod

### What you will need

- The Modbuddy SDK (Search in the steam's tool sections)
- Follow the wondeful [guide from the Xcom 2 modding subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/firsttime#wiki_how_to_install_and_set_up_xcom_2_wotc_sdk)
- Start the SDK, go in file then "open mod project" (you will need to extract the project's folder).
- Then do your changes.
